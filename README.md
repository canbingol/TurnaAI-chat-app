# TurnaAI - Chatbot with Turkish Language Model


TurnaAI is a web and mobile application platform designed to develop an artificial intelligence model capable of intelligent and natural conversations in Turkish. This project is being developed as part of the Software Engineering Department at Firat University, Faculty of Technology.

## Project Summary

TurnaAI aims to address deficiencies in the field of Turkish natural language processing by offering a specially trained Turkish language model. Within the scope of the project, a Turkish language model will be created **from scratch** using Python and PyTorch, **pretrained on an extensive Turkish dataset**, and optimized with **fine-tuning and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)** techniques.

The developed web and mobile applications will make the model accessible through a user-friendly interface, offering an advanced AI-based chat experience in the Turkish language.

## Features

- **Specially Trained Turkish Language Model:** TurnaAI is an AI model pretrained from scratch on a comprehensive Turkish dataset and optimized with fine-tuning
- **Advanced Response Generation with RLHF:** More natural, intelligent, and contextually coherent responses through human feedback
- **Web and Mobile Applications:** Easy access on all platforms
- **Real-time Response System:** Quick and intelligent answers to user questions

## Interface Features

- **Sleek UI:** Modern and user-friendly interface
- **Theme Options:** Dark, Light, and Purple theme choices
- **Multilingual Support:** Turkish, English, German, and French language options
- **Chat Modes:** Switch between Normal, Creative, and Precise modes
- **Markdown Support:** Formatting, code blocks, and lists
- **File Upload:** Support for various file formats
- **Sound Notifications:** Optional audio alerts
- **History Management:** Save and reload previous conversations
- **Export:** Export conversations in JSON format

## Technical Infrastructure

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Flask, FastAPI
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT-based secure login system
- **Language Model:** PyTorch, CUDA, Transformer, RLHF
- **Cloud & Deployment:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes

## Functional Programming Applications

In the TurnaAI project, **functional programming** paradigm will be applied to the language model developed using PyTorch and other components:

- **Pure Functions:** Model training and inference processes will be designed as pure functions
- **Immutability:** PyTorch tensors will be used as immutable data structures
- **Higher-Order Functions:** High-level functions for model training and evaluation
- **Functional Reactive Programming:** Data flows will be processed reactively

## Installation and Usage
